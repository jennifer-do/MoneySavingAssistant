# MoneySavingAssistant
This program is in development.
## What is it?
It will be a desktop application that stores the user's monthly spending limit and allows them to keep track of how much they have spent so far. It will have a bar to represent how much of the user's monthly spending limit has been used. Spending will be stored and reset at the end of each month. Spending for previous months will be displayed in the form of grids coloured on a gradient. 
## How can this be useful?
It is a simple program to help users keep track of and visualize their spending. The visualization and use of colours will encourage users to spend less.
